Simple C library for parsing and writing CSV files.

## Description ##

This is a little C library for loading, manipulating, and saving CSV files. 

Examples and source files can be found on [github](https://github.com/winobes/libscv).

I feel some obligation to say that there are certainly more robust C 
libraries out there for CSV and other plain text "flat files" (e.g. the one 
found [here](https://github.com/robertpostill/libCSV)  which has a customizable parser and malformed data flexibility). 

I am a beginner C programmer, and writing and implementing this library is 
primairly an exercise for me. Any feedback is much appreciated. You can 
contact me at <winobes@gmail.com>.

## Usage ##

This library is designed to be very simple to use. The CSV format is 
not very well standardized, and not all CSV files will be read properly
by the parser. It should be able to handle any file that it creates,
and any file that adheres to the following rules:

```c
```
